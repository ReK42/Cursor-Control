Cursor Control
======
**Cursor Control** provides access to the Home, End, Page Up and Page Down keys to owners of laptops with keyboards that do not have those keys present.

**Cursor Control** was created for owners of the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, which has a Print Screen key located next to the arrow keys, but could be made to function for any other layout with minimal modification.

## Key Combinations
| Key Combination     | Result    |
| :------------------ | :-------- |
| PrintScreen + Left  | Home      |
| PrintScreen + Right | End       |
| PrintScreen + Up    | Page Up   |
| PrintScreen + Down  | Page Down |

These key combinations also work with modifier keys, such as Alt, Ctrl, Shift and Win. For example, Ctrl+Shift+PrintScreen+Left results in Ctrl+Shift+Home.

## Running
